# TO DO

* ~Check data on previous vaccination --> can we use it in estimation of incubation period?~

* Check symptom onset dates for very negative serial intervals --> mistakes in data?

* ~***Incubation period***: vary the lower bound of exposure window to see the impact on estimates~

* ~***Incubation period***: using EpiLPS package~

* ~***Most likely network***: indicate sex workers - transmission matrix by age (assortativity?)~

* ~***Serial interval*** MCMC: sensitivity analysis with constraint [-10; 40] days~

* ~***Serial interval*** MCMC: sensitivity analysis where 'dont' remember' = sexual contact~ -> not occurring in pairs data

* ***Serial interval*** MCMC: sensitivity analysis -> ~if transmission hypothesis is sexual, only include the known sexual contacts (not other contacts)~ OR assign higher probability of being the infector?

* ***Serial interval*** MCMC: stratified by age group of source case

* ~***Serial interval*** MCMC: stratified by household vs non-household~

* ***Serial interval***: regression based on most likely network --> factors based on characteristics of source case (age, gender, transmission route, HH status, sex worker, ...)

* ***Serial interval***: include regression model in MCMC?

* ***Serial interval***: if only one contact is reported, how likely is it that transmission occurred? (see AJE paper)

* Estimate serial interval / incubation period using onset of rash instead of general symptom onset --> check how much data is available

* PCR-Ct values available to estimate infection time? (depending on sample type)
 

# Open questions

* Establish the presence of sexual transmission / other transmission routes: location of lesions, modes of exposure (contact w/ case, animal reservoir)

* Duration of hospitalisations: individual characteristics? clinical presentation?

* Infection severity: higher virulence and case fatality rate than Clade IIb, but lower than Clade Ia

* Pregnancy outcomes: vertical transmission?
