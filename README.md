# Open questions

* Establish the presence of sexual transmission / other transmission routes

* Duration of hospitalisations: individual characteristics? clinical presentation?

* Serial interval: stratified by attributes such as transmission route, age, gender

* Reconstruction of transmission tree / sequencing data (https://github.com/inrb-labgenpath/Mpox_sequencing_Kamituga)?

* Pregnancy outcomes: vertical transmission?
