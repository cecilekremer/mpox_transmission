# Open questions

* Establish the presence of sexual transmission / other transmission routes: location of lesions, modes of exposure (contact w/ case, animal reservoir)

* Duration of hospitalisations: individual characteristics? clinical presentation?

* Infection severity: higher virulence and case fatality rate than Clade IIb, but lower than Clade Ia

* Serial interval: stratified by attributes such as transmission route, age, gender

* Reconstruction of transmission tree 

* Pregnancy outcomes: vertical transmission?
