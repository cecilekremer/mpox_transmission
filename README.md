# TO DO

* ***Serial interval*** MCMC: sensitivity analysis -> ~if transmission hypothesis is sexual, only include the known sexual contacts (not other contacts)~ OR assign higher probability of being the infector?

* ***Serial interval***: regression model based on observed serial intervals (only one contact, N = 76) --> factors based on characteristics of source case (age, gender, transmission route, HH status, sex worker, ...); Bayesian regression?

* ***Serial interval***: if only one contact is reported, how likely is it that transmission occurred? (see AJE paper)

* ***Serial interval***: use date of last contact as infection time (i.e. generation interval) --> check for how many pairs this is available for both cases

* ***Serial interval***: co-primary cases -> mixture model? (Miura et al?)

* Presymptomatic transmission: does it more often / exclusively occur via sexual transmission? -> 4 out of 6 pairs w/ presympt transmission report sexual contact

* ~Estimate serial interval and incubation period using onset of rash instead of general symptom onset~

* PCR-Ct values available to estimate infection time? (depending on sample type) --> better estimates of incubation period

* Overview of symptoms (table with most reported symptoms) + evolution over the course of infection?

* Duration of hospital stay -> severity of symptoms? type of symptoms?

* Pregnancy outcomes -> is there enough data to say something about vertical transmission?

* mpox in household -> within which timeframe? (ask in meeting 5/11)

* Which data are available for PCR-negative cases?
 

# Open questions

* Establish the presence of sexual transmission / other transmission routes: location of lesions, modes of exposure (contact w/ case, animal reservoir)

* Duration of hospitalisations: individual characteristics? clinical presentation?

* Infection severity: higher virulence and case fatality rate than Clade IIb, but lower than Clade Ia

* Pregnancy outcomes: vertical transmission?
